# Python 3 (Coded in 2020)

# Thread Shed keeps its register of all of the transaction information in one string called daily_sales. 
# For each transaction, the name of the customer, amount spent, types of thread purchased, and the date of sale is recorded in this same string. 

# The task is to iterate through the string and clean up each transaction and store all the information in easier to access lists.

##   FIRST STEP - CLEANING   ##

#How is each transaction stored? 
# Each transaction is separated with a coma starting by name of the customer and ending with the date.

#How is each piece of data within the transaction stored?
#Within each transaction, the values are separated with a ;,; between each of the values,there're (sometimes) also spaces of inconsistent length. 
#At the end of a transaction (date) and the begining of the next (name), sometimes there are spaces and sometimes not, but it is always separated by the comma that marks the new transaction, there's no ;,; between the date at the end and the name at the beginning of the next transaction.



# 1. We need to replace the artifact ;,; to something without a comma, so we don’t split any transactions themselves.

daily_sales_replaced = daily_sales.replace(";,;", "!!!!")

# print(daily_sales_replaced)




# 2. Split into a list of each individual transaction:

daily_transactions = daily_sales_replaced.split(",")

#print(daily_transactions)



#3.  Split each individual transaction into a list of its data points

daily_transactions_split = []
for item in daily_transactions:
  daily_transactions_split.append(item.split("!!!!"))
#print(daily_transactions_split)



#4. Replace new line caracters with an empty string and then clean whitespace with .strip() 
transactions_clean = []
for transaction in daily_transactions_split:
  transaction_clean = []
  for each_data_point in transaction:
    transaction_clean.append(each_data_point.replace("\n", "").strip(" "))
  transactions_clean.append(transaction_clean)


#print(transactions_clean)






##  SECOND STEP, GET THE DATA  ## 

# Collect the individual data points for each transaction in these lists: customers, sales, and thread_sold.

customers =[] 
sales =[] 
thread_sold =[] 

for transaction in transactions_clean:
  customers.append(transaction[0])
  sales.append(transaction[1])
  thread_sold.append(transaction[2])

#print(customers)
#print(sales)
#print(thread_sold)



# to know how much Thread Shed made in a day:
total_sales = 0
for sale in sales:  
  total_sales += float(sale.strip("$"))
#print(sales)
#print (total_sales)



# we want to determine how many of each color thread we sold today (a list that contains an item for each color thread sold)
#thread_sold is a list of strings, some are single colors and some are multiple colors separated by the & character, so we need to split them again.
#print(thread_sold)

thread_sold_split = []

for sale in thread_sold:
  for color in sale.split('&'):
    thread_sold_split.append(color)
#print(thread_sold_split)



# Count the number of sales for each color:
# color_count takes one argument "color". It iterates through thread_sold_split 
# and count the number of times the item is equal to argument "color" and then returns this count.

def color_count(color):
  count = 0
  for item in thread_sold_split:
    if (item == color):
      count += 1;
  return count;

# TESTS
#print(color_count("blue"))
#print(color_count("green"))
#print(color_count("yellow"))
#print(color_count("white"))




# The list colors stores all of the colored threads that Thread Shed offers. 
# Iterate through thread_sold_split and print a sentence that says how many threads of each color were sold today.

colors = ['red','yellow','green','white','black','blue','purple']

# Simple solution
for color in colors:
  print("Today we sold " + str(color_count(color))+ " " + color +" threads" )



# Solution using format: 

for color in colors:
  print(
    "Thread Shed sold today {0} threads of {1} threads today.".format(color_count(color), color)
  )
